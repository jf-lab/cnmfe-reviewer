## Installation

### Software requirements
1. Python 3.5+ (ideally with Anaconda) 
2. Clone or download this repository onto a local folder on your computer.
3. Change to the directory where you downloaded `cnmfe-reviewer`.
    `cd /path/to/cnfme-reviewer`
4. Create a dedicated conda environment for use of this package (highly recommended to prevent versioning issues with packages you already have installed). Instructions below, but for more detailed instructions, [click here for the conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).

```
# replace myenv_name with your environment name (e.g. cnmfereview)
conda create -n myenv_name python=3.6

# when conda asks to proceed, type 'y'
# this puts your environment in a default folder under the hood
